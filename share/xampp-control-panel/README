XAMPP Control Panel v0.6
Written by Jono Bacon (jono@jonobacon.org)

This is a small program that can be used to control the XAMPP web development stack.
This tool allows you to graphically start and stop the different XAMPP components easily.

> Requirements <

To run the XAMPP Control Panel, you will need:

	Linux (may work on other OSs)
	GTK 2.x
	PyGTK (also known as python-gtk) 2.x
	XAMPP

> Running <

This program needs to be run as root as the XAMPP components need root level
access to run. While root, change to the directory where you unzipped the
code and run the XAMPP Control Panel with:

foo@bar:~$ ./xampp-control-panel.py 

You first need to set the directory in which XAMPP is installed. Click on the
Preferences button to set this.

Just click the buttons to start the different XAMPP components. Simple. :)

> Subversion Access <

The code is now available at svn.jonobacon.org/svn/xampp-control-panel
